# Customer Satisfaction

## Business Scope & Benefits

For the hotel operations within VGT, customer satisfaction is an important contributor to the overall efficiency and profitability of their business. This has been recognised by the hotel industry for several years: *"Service quality and customer satisfaction have gradually been recognized as key factors used to gain competitive advantage and customer retention"* [@yang2011]. If the levels of satisfaction across different aspects of a customers experience can be quantified, then action can be focused on improving those areas that are lacking. Clearly, identifying the areas that contribute most is part of the challenge. Not surprisingly, the use of data science to assist in this area is increasingly important [@zarezadeh2022].

### Measuring Customer Satisfaction

There are several aspects to quantifying customer satisfaction, for example:

-   The specific areas of interest. Such as cleanliness, service experience, quality of facilities, local amenities and even things such as wifi availability
-   Customer satisfaction ranking. Obtaining a customer's views on how poor to excellent a specific area was
-   Importance to the business. The appropriate weighting of the importance of each area.

It has become standard practice and easy to gather customer feedback on how they rate their experience after a stay at a hotel through check-out questionnaires and feedback requests [@li2013], and also increasingly utilising reviews in services such as [Booking.Com](https://www.booking.com) and as [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk). VGT already has some feedback mechanisms and some historical customer satisfaction data that can be used initially.

Previous studies have looked at a way of pulling the above aspects together and an example is the use of a matrix, an "I-S Model" [@yang2011], see an example at @fig-IS-Example. This categorises the areas of interest and helps highlight those areas performing well and those not, whilst also reflecting their importance to the business. In particular, areas in the "To-be-improved" quadrant are important but have not met customer expectations and so these are areas that a hotel's management team can focus on to improve the business.

## Data Analysis Approach

In a similar way to Demand Forecasting, VGT does not currently formally analyse the experience of its customers across all hotels and then use this to inform management actions to improve its services. However, VGT does have a good history of customer ratings data that can be utilised initially to experiment with ways of more formally measuring customer satisfaction. If positive, then this can then be extended in sophistication and scope of data collection (see @sec-custnextsteps).

The objective of this initial experimentation step is to establish a process that can utilise existing historical customer review data for a single hotel and create an IS-Model to determine possible actions. In summary, the approach is to:

-   Collate customer details and satisfaction ratings
-   Utilise these to identify what are the areas that customers regard as important
-   Establish a CSAT prediction model
-   Combine the above to create an IS-Model for historic data and also for prediction
-   Use the IS-Model to identify actions that can improve customer service.

### Data Required

The scope of the data is all the historical customer satisfaction ratings that VGT customers have provided after staying at a hotel. For consistency a Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) will be used, this is a 5 point Likert scale from "very dissatisfied" to "very satisfied" [@bishop2022]. Data points required are:

-   Overall customer rating
-   Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Residence)
-   Trip Background (Purpose, Travel Type, Booking Type)
-   Individual service ratings (Amenities, Staff, Cleanliness, Wifi etc).

### Classification Techniques to Determine Importance

The aim is to use a classification model to determine how the different factors contribute to the overall customer rating, ie to determine the relative importance of each factor. The target variable 'y' is the overall CSAT and the input feature set 'X' consists of the demographics, trip background and individual service ratings. The created model will provide an initial indication of the relative importance across the feature set. The model can then also be used to provide predictions of the CSAT in response to value changes for individual features and this can help hotel management teams focus in planning what actions to take to improve customer service

Potential classification approaches for multi-class classification include:

-   Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-   K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
-   Naive Bayes (NB)
-   Decision Tree (DT)
-   Random Forest (RF)
-   Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).

A comparison of the classification of customer reviews, [@noori2021], examined several models, including: SVM, KNN, NB, DT; a DT approach was found to be the most accurate. Another examination of how to identify the important predictors of customer reviews found DT to be an accurate approach[@baouchi2018]. Extending the DT approach, XGBoost has found to be a successful model in many situations [@chen2016]. In this initial examination, XGBoost was used.

## Simulated Data Analysis

### Data Summary

A dataset was created to simulate the data as defined in the earlier section. The data elements consist of:

{{< embed ../../Notebooks_Data_Analysis/customer_satisfaction.ipynb#csv_file_types >}}

The first few elements of the loaded data:

{{< embed ../../Notebooks_Data_Analysis/customer_satisfaction.ipynb#csv_file_summary >}}

And key descriptive statistics:

{{< embed ../../Notebooks_Data_Analysis/customer_satisfaction.ipynb#csv_file_stats >}}

### XGBoost Model Creation & Evaluation

An XGBoost model was created using the above dataset randomly split 80:20 into training and testing data. The initial model was evaluated and a Confusion Matrix, Shap Values and F-Score were generated. The F-Score of 52% was not high whcih indicates the prediction are not very accurate and so more hyper-parameter tuning will be required; however, as an initial examination the model was used.

The relative feature importance ranking was calculated, shown in the figure below. Age clearly has a much larger importance than any of the other features.

{{< embed ../../Notebooks_Data_Analysis/customer_satisfaction.ipynb#feature-importance >}}

It is useful to see what customer demographic factors and travel type impact the overall CSAT, however these can not be directly changed by the hotel's management team, so a second model was generated using just the individual service scores and this feature importance ranking is shown in the figure below. There is a closer spread of importance, with wifi and transport being the most important.

### I-S Model

Using the predicted feature rankings, an I-S Model can be compared, and an I-S Model created.

## Conclusions & Next Steps {#sec-custnextsteps}

### Findings

### Next Steps

Use the Model / Predictions / Business Use

-   ***?! More processing capacity***
-   Look at action areas
-   Change feature values and consider impact on overall CSAT
-   Monitor changes and impact on scores etc
-   Extend to hotels
-   ***?? Find a way to plot over time eg @yang2011 improvement index, p 353***

Modelling Improvements / Refine

-   additional customer features that might be useful
-   Enhance customer collection approach, standardise across hotels
-   third-party / other hotels to help rank importance and provide a comparative/competitor scoring/comparison ... Having utilised its own internal data on customer reviews, VGT will be like much of the hotel industry in not significantly incorporating third-party review data from sources such as [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk) and a next-step is to investigate how to extract, analyse and incorporate this data [@park2023].
-   compare across hotels and also competitors for satisfaction factors etc
